Car Data Analysis Project:

This project involves the implementation of a data analysis task using Python. The primary objective is to explore and visualize a dataset of cars, cars.csv, by generating two types of visualizations: histograms and scatter plots. The dataset includes attributes such as car name, origin, horsepower, miles per gallon, weight in lbs, and more.

File: 

cars.csv

Attributes:

Name: The name of the car.
Miles_per_Gallon: Fuel efficiency in miles per gallon.
Cylinders: Number of cylinders in the car's engine.
Displacement: Engine displacement in cubic inches.
Horsepower: Engine horsepower.
Weight_in_lbs: Weight of the car in pounds.
Acceleration: Acceleration time from 0 to 60 mph in seconds.
Year: Model year of the car.
Origin: Country of origin (e.g., USA, Europe, Japan).

Python libraries:

pandas

matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using pip:

-pip install pandas matplotlib

-Running the Scripts

Conclusion

This project demonstrates basic data analysis and visualization techniques using Python. By generating histograms and scatter plots, we can gain insights into the distribution and relationships of different attributes within the car dataset.
